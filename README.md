# Multi-Agent PDF Report Generator

This project is a **multi-agent workflow system** that generates content using a Large Language Model (LLM) and produces a PDF report. Each agent in the workflow has a specific role:

- **Content Agent:** Generates the main content based on the user query  
- **PDF Agent:** Creates a PDF with headings, body text, summary, and optional icon  
- **Workflow Agent:** Manages the interaction between agents and ensures smooth execution  

The system demonstrates how multiple agents can collaborate to create structured reports efficiently.

## Features

- Content generation based on user query
- Automatic PDF creation with heading, body, summary, and optional icon
- Brand identity support (colors and fonts)
- PDF filenames are randomly generated to avoid overwriting
- Fully modular agent-based architecture
- Built using **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, and **ReportLab**

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Pip package manager

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Set environment variables:**

Create a .env file in the project root with:
```bash
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```
Replace your_groq_api_key_here with a valid Grok API key.


## Usage

1. Open Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE and navigate to the main notebook/script. You can also use jupyter by using the following command.
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
2. Run the workflow cells in order:

- Cell 1: Imports and setup

- Cell 2 & 3: Content and PDF node definitions

- Cell 4: Workflow graph creation

- Cell 5: Execute workflow with your query

- Cell 6: Verify and save PDF with a random unique filename

3. Set your query in Cell 5:
```bash
query = "Democracy"  # Replace with your topic
```
4. Run the notebook. Example console output:
```bash
[System] Executing workflow for query: Democracy
[Content Agent] Generating content for query: Democracy

[System] PDF will be saved as: report_5265.pdf

```

## Output

- PDF contains:
- Title (Heading)
- Report content (Body)
- Summary (Body)
- Optional icon if available
- Example filename: report_4352.pdf



Notes

Brand identity fonts in PDFs must be installed on the system to avoid errors. Default fonts (Helvetica) are always safe.

PDF filenames use a random number (0â€“15000) to avoid overwriting previous reports.

LLM responses are generated using Grok API with LangChain.

### Troubleshooting

Missing API Key Error: Ensure .env file exists with a valid GROQ_API_KEY.

### Font Mapping Error: 
Use default fonts in DEFAULT_BRAND_IDENTITY if custom fonts are not installed.

### PDF Overwrite: 
The name of the generated pdf file would be based on the current time and would be saved in the same folder.
